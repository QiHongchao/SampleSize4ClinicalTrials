Description
------------

<strong>cvGEE</strong> calculates cross-validated versions of the logarithmic, quadratic and spherical scoring rules based on generalized estimating equations.

The package presumes that the GEE has been solved using the `geeglm()` function of the [**geepack**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geepack).

- For `family = gaussian()` only the quadratic rule is available calculated as the squared prediction error; lower values indicate a better predictive ability.

- For `family = binomial()` and dichotomous outcome data the probabilities for the two categories are calculated from the Bernoulli probability mass function. For `family = binomial()` and binomial data the probabilities for each possible response are calculated from a beta-binomial distribution with variance set equal to the variance from the corresponding quasi-likelihood behind the GEE. Likewise for `family = poisson()` the probabilities for the number of events up to a particular maximum (set using the `max_count` argument) are calculated using the negative binomial distribution with variance set equal to the variance from the corresponding quasi-likelihood behind the GEE. For these families all three scoring rules are available, with higher values in each rule indicating better predictive ability.


Basic Use
------------

We compare a linear and a nonlinear GEE for the dichotomized version of the serum bilirubin biomarker from the PBC dataset:
```r
library("geepack")
library("cvGEE")
library("splines")
library("lattice")

pbc2$serBilirD <- as.numeric(pbc2$serBilir > 1.2)

gm1 <- geeglm(serBilirD ~ year * drug, 
              family = binomial(), data = pbc2, id = id, 
              corstr = "exchangeable")

gm2 <- geeglm(serBilirD ~ ns(year, 3, Boundary.knots = c(0, 10)) * drug, 
              family = binomial(), data = pbc2, id = id, 
              corstr = "exchangeable")

plot_data <- cv_gee(gm1, return_data = TRUE)
plot_data$linear <- plot_data$.score
plot_data$non_linear <- unlist(cv_gee(gm2))

xyplot(linear + non_linear ~ year | .rule, data = plot_data, 
       type = "smooth", auto.key = TRUE, layout = c(3, 1),
       scales = list(y = list(relation = "free")),
       xlab = "Follow-up time (years)", ylab = "Scoring Rules")
```

Installation
------------
